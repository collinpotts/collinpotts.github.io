                <h2>Projects</h2>
                <p>The main project I have created is a web application that allows users to practice chess openings and save them for later reference. 
                    It consists of a frontend that is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and a backend that is built with Node.js and a PostgreSQL database.
                    This application challenged me to manipulate HTML in my javascript code to render the interactive chessboard and required efficiency in axios
                    to make calls to endpoints fetching and manipulating the data on the backend.
